A very small (15 lines of code) and beautiful fetch script (exclusively for Arch Linux).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many fetch scripts out there but I wanted a very minimal and beautiful fetch 
script that works.

It is made in python but due to its extremly small size it takes no time to load, it is
almost an instant (0m0.021s to be exact).

At the moment it will work fine on ArchLinux but on other distros it doesn't shows their
respective logo and name correctly (only shows ArchLinux logo and  name) but can be changed 
by user manually by going through the python code.

Thank You.
